# HW-Wireframe

* This is my first homework submission for the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin.

* I initially had trouble with getting the clearfix syntax to work, but discovered that placement was the issue. 

* I also had a challenge with getting #ID Top and #Id Bottom placed correctly in the Article box. I discovered padding and margins were the issue. 

* I wasn't able to get all the elements perfectly positioned in the body.
